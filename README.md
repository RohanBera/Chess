# Chess

This is a Simple Chess AI implemented completely in python. We started this as a small side project to amuse ourselves. Lots of youtube videos and medium articles here we are, we're rather proud of it. This project is made using python. 

###Goals to achieve:

1. Make the Chess Engine works. 
2. Make the Chess Engine follow rules.
3. Optimise movements of Chess Engine.
4. Optimise the choices it makes.
5. Train the engine along with model data.
6. Create a neural network to make the engine optimise moves by itself.
7. Train the neural network with the model data. Physically test the AI.
8. Pit our AI against other AI's
9. Our final goal is to match upto AlphaZero.


We used the Databases from the [FICS Database](https://ficsgames.org/download "FICS Games") from `www.ficsgames.org/download`

In python we used the [chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library to read the PGN files and train our model
