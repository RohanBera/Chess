# Chess

This is a Simple Chess AI implemented completely in python. We started this as a small side project to amuse ourselves. Lots of youtube videos and medium articles here we are, we're rather proud of it. This project is made using python. 

Goals to achieve:

1. Make the Chess Engine works. 
2. Make the Chess Engine follow rules.
3. Optimise movements of Chess Engine.
4. Optimise the choices it makes.
5. Train the engine along with model data.
6. Create a neural network to make the engine optimise moves by itself.
