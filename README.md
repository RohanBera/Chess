# Chess

This is a Simple Chess AI implemented completely in python. We started this as a small side project to amuse ourselves. Lots of youtube videos and medium articles here we are, we're rather proud of it. This project is made using python. 

###Goals to achieve:

- [ ] Make the Chess Engine works. 
- [ ] Make the Chess Engine follow rules.
- [ ] Optimise movements of Chess Engine.
- [ ] Optimise the choices it makes.
- [ ] Train the engine along with model data.
- [ ] Create a neural network to make the engine optimise moves by itself.
- [ ] Train the neural network with the model data. Physically test the AI.
- [ ] Pit our AI against other AI's
- [ ] Our final goal is to match upto AlphaZero.


We used the Databases from the [FICS Database](https://ficsgames.org/download "FICS Games") from `www.ficsgames.org/download`

In python we used the [chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library to read the PGN files and train our model
